            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Josh Aney, and I am currently a computer science student at Montana State University.
                I am in my third year and I plan on graduating in the spring of 2026. Ever since I have been young, I
                have always been fascinated with how computers, video games, or any other sort of software worked. I
                could tell from a young age that I would be interested in pushing the limits of technology and applying
                it into my own day-to-day life to solve problems</p>
            <p>When I am not completing school work or working on other projects, I enjoy spending time outdoors. I love
                getting out into the mountains to ski or bike. I live for any sort of adventures that will get me outside</p>
            <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
            <p>In school, I have grown to be very interested in the world of machine learning. I enjoy working with a
                group of my peers to solve a problem that is given to us. Working in a group gives me a chance bounce ideas
                off of other people to allow me to find new ways to manipulate a dataset or approach a certain challenge.
                I also love getting to work with the math involved in many of these problems. I had the opportunity to
                code a few common machine learning algorithms from scratch, and it truly gave me a new perspective of
                why math is so important in my everyday life.</p>
            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>During the 2024 summer I got the opportunity to work with the CaMP (Cybernetics and Motor Physiology) lab
                at Mayo Clinic. I worked with Dr. Kai Miller on a research project that involved me analyzing voltage
                traces from the brain with different machine learning techniques. This experience taught be a lot about
                how to handle real world challenges that could be faced when working in the machine learning field. I
                often had to work with small datasets that would have missing values or noisy data. This caused me to be
                very conscious on how I trained the models and how I chose which models to use.</p>
            <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
            <p>For the past two years, I have been able to be a part of the Spirit of the West Drumline. I started
                playing musical instruments at a young age, and I have been hooked ever since. I now have the privilege
                of playing snare drum at all of Montana State University's home football games which has been one of the
                best experiences of my entire life.</p>
            <p>I am also Co-President of the Montana State Club Tennis Team. Sports have always been a large part of my
                life since a young age, and I am so happy that I am able to give students an opportunity to continue playing
                or pick up tennis at a low cost when they come to college.</p>
