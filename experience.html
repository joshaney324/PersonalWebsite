            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

            <h3>Research Assistant - Montana State University (HACR Lab)</h3>
            <p><em>Montana State University - Current Position Spring 2026</em></p>
            <p>Working with a PhD student on CodeDistill, a research project focused on learning
                embeddings for code. The approach uses graph neural networks (GNNs) that take control
                flow graphs generated by Ghidra as input to learn meaningful representations of program
                structure and behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Skills & Technologies:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Graph Neural Networks</li>
                <li>Ghidra (Reverse Engineering)</li>
                <li>Control Flow Graph Analysis</li>
                <li>Code Embeddings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Undergraduate Research Intern - Mayo Clinic (CaMP Lab)</h3>
            <p><em>Cybernetics and Motor Physiology Lab, Department of Neurosurgery - Summer 2024, Summer 2025, and part-time during academic year</em></p>
            <p>Worked with Dr. Kai Miller analyzing stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) signals recorded
                from intracranial electrodes during a modified auditory oddball task. I applied and modified
                Canonical Response Parameterization (CRP), a data-driven method originally developed for
                electrical stimulation data, to characterize auditory evoked potentials across cortical
                sites and task conditions.</p>

            <p>The research demonstrated that CRP can quantify neural response magnitude, duration, and
                reproducibility without relying on predefined peaks or latency windows. Key findings showed
                stronger cortical responses to novel tones and modulation of auditory processing by
                attentional state during a concurrent visual task.</p>

            <p>I am first author on a manuscript currently in review: <em>"Parameterization of intracranial
                auditory evoked responses reveals cortical novelty and attention effects."</em></p>

            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Working with clinical neural data required developing robust
                approaches to handle noisy signals and data cleaning. The short inter-stimulus intervals
                required implementing high-pass filtering techniques rather than traditional baseline
                subtraction to prevent response contamination between trials.</p>

            <p>At the end of each summer, I presented my findings to my PI, principal investigators from
                related labs, and other undergraduate research interns.</p>

                <li>MATLAB, Signal Processing</li>

            <h2>Academic Experience</h2>

            <h3>Independent Study - CSCI 491-7 Hypermedia Systems</h3>
            <p><em>Montana State University - Fall 2025</em></p>
            <p>Collaborated with a professor and a team of three students to design and develop a semester-long
                project template for an advanced web development course. The project teaches a hypermedia-first
                approach to web development, emphasizing server-side rendering with htmx as an alternative to
                single-page application architectures.</p>

            <p>I was responsible for implementing the core website functionality, including the MVC controller
                layer, authentication and authorization systems, and multi-step business workflows. The application
                is a veterinary clinic management system with two user roles (veterinarians and pet owners),
                featuring appointment scheduling, invoicing, prescription management, and a messaging system.</p>

            <p><strong>Curriculum Design:</strong> A key challenge was balancing project complexity for students.
                We designed the database schema with 11 interconnected tables including polymorphic relationships
                (shared Account model for Owner and Vet) and complex features like conversation-based messaging.
                This provides enough depth to teach real-world patterns like role-based access control, pagination,
                and transactional integrity without overwhelming students. The progressive assignment structure
                allows students to implement new controllers by following established patterns in the codebase.</p>
