                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Josh Aney, and I am a computer science student at Montana State University, currently in my fourth
                        year with plans to graduate in spring 2026. From a young age, I have been fascinated by how computers,
                        video games, and other software systems work. That curiosity naturally grew into a passion for pushing the limits
                        of technology and applying it to real-world problems in my everyday life.</p>
                    <p>Outside of school and project work, I enjoy spending time outdoors. I love
                        getting out into the mountains to ski or bike. I live for any sort of adventure that will get me outside.
                        Throughout my experience at Montana State, I have enjoyed getting out skiing at Bridger Bowl, biking in
                        Hyalite Canyon, and spending time with my friends playing music with the marching band.</p>
                    <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
                    <p>Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong interest in machine learning. I enjoy collaborating
                        with peers to solve challenging problems, as working in a group allows me to exchange ideas and discover
                        new ways to approach and manipulate data. I am particularly drawn to the mathematical foundations behind
                        these models. Having the opportunity to implement several machine learning algorithms from scratch gave me
                        a deeper appreciation for how essential mathematics is in both problem-solving and real-world applications.</p>
                    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                    <p>I am currently working with the CaMP (Cybernetics and Motor Physiology) lab
                        at Mayo Clinic. I worked with Dr. Kai Miller on a research project that involved me analyzing voltage
                        traces from the brain with different machine learning techniques. This experience taught me a lot about
                        how to handle real world challenges that could be faced when working in the machine learning field. I
                        often had to work with small datasets that would have missing values or noisy data. This caused me to be
                        very conscious on how I trained the models and how I chose which models to use.</p>
                    <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
                    <p>For the past three years, I have been able to be a part of the Spirit of the West Drumline. I started
                        playing musical instruments at a young age, and I have been hooked ever since. I now have the privilege
                        of playing snare drum at all of Montana State University's home football games which has been one of the
                        best experiences of my entire life. This past year, I had the opportunity to be the snare drum section leader
                        which taught me many lessons on how to be a leader and work with a large group of people.</p>
                    <p>I am also Co-President of the Montana State Club Tennis Team. Sports have always been a large part of my
                        life since a young age. I am so happy that I am able to give students an opportunity to continue playing
                        or pick up tennis at a low cost when they come to college as well as giving students a place to compete
                        in a sport they love.</p>
