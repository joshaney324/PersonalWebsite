            <h2>Machine Learning Project 2 - K Nearest Neighbors Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: For this project, I worked in a team with two other students at Montana
                State University.
                We were tasked with coding a KNN classification model, KNN regression model, edited KNN classification
                model, edited KNN regression model, and a K-Means clustering model from scratch. We then used these
                models on a variety of datasets. We used the
                <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original">Breast Cancer
                    Wisconsin Dataset</a>,
                <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/42/glass+identification">Glass Identification Dataset</a>,
                <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/91/soybean+small">Soybean (Small) Dataset</a>,
                <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone">Abalone Dataset</a>,
                <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires">Forest Fires Dataset</a>, and the
                <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/29/computer+hardware">Computer Hardware Dataset</a>.
                For the classification datasets, a base KNN classification model was created. To do this we took out a
                hold-out fold from the data to tune all the hyperparameters for the model. Once the model was tuned,
                10-fold
                cross validation was completed with the remaining data. There was no removal of noisy data during this
                run.
                We then completed another run of this experiment, but we used an edited KNN classification model, so the
                model would remove data points that it got wrong. This in turn ended up removing noise. A similar
                process
                was completed for the regression datasets, but the only difference in the model was that a kernel was
                used to weight the distance of the K closest neighbors instead of just going with the mean of the k
                closest neighbors. For the edited KNN regression model, we had to tune a threshold for how close the
                prediction was to the actual value to decide if the model would remove the datapoint. Finally, we
                performed the experiment one more time, but instead of using edited KNN models to find the edited
                dataset,
                we used the centroids from a K-Means Clustering model. Once these experiments were completed, we then
                analyzed and compared the results from all the different models</p>

            <p><strong>Results</strong>: Many of the K Nearest Neighbors Methods performed better on classification data
                then on regression data.
                The performance of individual models depended on the structure of each dataset. Depending on if the
                dataset
                contained large amounts of outliers, the K-Means model or the edited model would perform better.</p>
